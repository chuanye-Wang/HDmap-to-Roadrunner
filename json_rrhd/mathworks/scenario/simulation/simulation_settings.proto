  // Example: 
  // - A pace of 1.0 would mean that for every second on the wall clock, the
  //   simulation would also complete running 1 second.
  // - A pace of 0.5 would mean that for every second on the wall clock, the
  //   simulation would have simulated 0.5 second (i.e., slower).
  // - A pace of 2.0 would mean that for every 1 second on the wall clock, the

  // Simulation engine applies a lower limit of 0.001 on this pace value.
